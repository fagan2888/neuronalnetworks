    "The `neuronalnetworks` package facilitates construction and simulation of dynamical neuronal networks. The core of the package consists of efficient implementations of a number of popular neuronal dynamics models (e.g., leaky integrate-and-fire, FitzHugh-Nagumo, Izhikehich). Other modules can be used to construct sophisticated networks by adding batches of independently parametrizable neurons, specifying geometric structure, generating connectivity matrices, and/or defining inputs. These built-in functionalities can be flexibly mixed and matched or combined with the user's own methods (e.g., arbitrary connectivity specification). All network parameters and components are accessible and modifiable before and during the simulation loop, allowing for full control of rich simulation scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk through the construction and simulation of a network using the `neuronalnetworks` package. We will rapidly build up an elaborate neuronal network and execute a dynamic simulation scenario. While perhaps not biologically maeningful, this simulation will illustrate the range of functionalities offered by this package."
